- was having trouble loading assets pulled from sketch fab. When trying to use the auto generated GLTF for some of the models, the textures would never load. and sometimes the mesh would take a couple of minutes to load.
- Instead, just looked for a free earth texture and applied it to a sphere.
- Created the model via Microsoft's 3d builder
- This is also a good resource:
